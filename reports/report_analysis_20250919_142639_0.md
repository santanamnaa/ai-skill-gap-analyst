Executive Summary:

Santana Mena is a 5-year veteran with experience primarily in tech. He has expertise in coding, Git, AWS, Docker, and Python. In terms of skills, Santana's knowledge is limited on AI technologies like TensorFlow or PyTorch, which are core to the role of a Senior AI Engineer.

Candidate Profile:

Santana Mena brings an impressive 5 years of experience to our team. He is particularly strong in coding, Git, AWS, and Docker, as well as having some proficiency with Python and JavaScript. However, he lacks expertise in machine learning technologies like TensorFlow or PyTorch which are key for the role of Senior AI Engineer.

Market Requirements Analysis:

The current market for Senior AI Engineers is very high, with a salary range from $120,000 to $200,000. The demand for AI and Machine Learning professionals is growing rapidly due to the emergence of Generative AI, MLOps, Edge AI, and Responsible AI.

Skill Gap Assessment:

The primary recommendation here would be to Upskill Santana with additional Python Machine Learning courses or certifications relevant to his new role. Additionally, we can recommend resources like Coursera or edX for Santana to learn about AI technologies that are core to the Senior AI Engineer role.

Upskilling Roadmap:

Our 6-week plan includes three phases: Introduction, Mastery, and Application. For the first phase (Introduction), Santana would get an overview of essential AI topics. For the second phase (Mastery), he will delve deeper into machine learning concepts through in-depth courses like DataCamp or Coursera. Finally, for the third phase (Application) we recommend that Santana applies these skills in a hands-on project, such as Kaggle competitions.

Recommended Resources:

For free learning platforms, consider using platforms like Codecademy or Pluralsight. For practice resources, consider coding challenges on LeetCode or HackerRank. For specific skill resources, we suggest the Coursera AI Specialization or edX Deep Learning course.

Certification Paths:
- Python Programming - Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- TensorFlow for Machine Learning
- PyTorch: Practical Machine Learning with Python and PyTorch

By implementing this Upskilling Roadmap, Santana can not only meet market requirements but also increase his value as a Senior AI Engineer. He will be equipped with the necessary skills to excel in our team, contributing effectively to our projects.

Santana Mena's experience, coding knowledge, AWS proficiency, and Git expertise make him a solid candidate for the role of Senior AI Engineer. However, his lack of expertise in machine learning is a gap that can be filled through Upskilling with certifications like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
