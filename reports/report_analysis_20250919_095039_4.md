Executive Summary:

As we analyze Santana Mena's CV and experience, we identify several key strengths. His technical skills in Python and JavaScript are particularly impressive. Additionally, he has valuable experience working on web development projects.

Santana is currently well-versed in core requirements for a Senior AI Engineer, such as proficiency with programming languages like Python and Machine Learning technologies, and knowledge of MLOps and TensorFlow/Keras frameworks. However, there is room for improvement in his leadership skills and architecture expertise.

Given Santana's current skill set analysis and market requirements for senior AI engineers, we recommend that he focus on developing more leadership capabilities and exploring opportunities to expand his architectural expertise.

Market Insights:

The job market for Senior AI Engineers is very high, with a salary range from $120,000 - $200,000. Emerging trends in the field include generative AI, MLOps, edge AI, and responsible AI. Santana's strong foundation makes him attractive to companies looking to leverage these technologies.

Tech Stack Popularity:

- Python: Strongly recommended for data science tasks.
- TensorFlow/Keras frameworks: Essential for deep learning projects.
- Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Git, MLflow, Weights & Biases: Essential for MLOps and edge AI developments.

Skill Gap Assessment:

Santana's skill set is currently lacking in leadership skills (no experience), as well as architecture expertise (no prior knowledge of programming languages or data structures). This means he may struggle with tasks requiring project planning, team management, and understanding broader software architecture frameworks. To mitigate this, we recommend that Santana focuses on learning and developing these key skills through self-study and possibly formal training courses.

Upskilling Roadmap:

- 6-week plan with 3 phases:
  - Phase 1: Python and Machine Learning (3 weeks)
    - Goals: Complete a course in basic machine learning techniques.
    - Deliverables: Complete the first module of a beginner machine learning course on Coursera or Edx.

  - Phase 2: AWS, Docker, Git, MLflow (3 weeks)
    - Goals: Learn best practices for deploying and managing ML models using popular tools.
    - Deliverables: Complete the first module of an AWS Essentials course or the Introduction to Docker & Containers with a Linux Foundation badge from Udemy.

- Phase 3: Leadership Development (2 weeks)
    - Goals: Gain experience in leading teams, project planning, and strategic decision-making.
    - Deliverables: Complete a beginner-level leadership development course on LinkedIn Learning or Udemy.
  
Recommended Resources:

- Free learning platforms: Coursera, Edx, LinkedIn Learning, Udemy
- Hands-on practice resources: Kaggle competitions, DataCamp tutorials, GitHub Projects
- Skill-specific resources: AI-related books and articles from reputable authors
- Professional development resources: Online courses offered by companies like Microsoft, IBM, or Google
- Certification paths: Courses on Coursera for certifications like AWS Certified Machine Learning Engineer

In summary, Santana Mena has several key strengths. However, his current skill set analysis highlights a gap in leadership and architecture expertise. To fill this gap, we recommend Santana focuses on upskilling in these areas through self-study and training courses.

He can begin by learning Python and basic machine learning techniques with Coursera's Beginner Machine Learning course. Next, he should become familiar with AWS, Docker, Git, MLflow, and other key MLOps tools with a certification from LinkedIn Learning or Udemy. Finally, Santana needs to develop leadership skills through self-study and possibly formal training courses.

By following this roadmap, Santana can gain the knowledge and experience required for his desired position as a Senior AI Engineer in the fast-growing field of generative AI and MLOps.
