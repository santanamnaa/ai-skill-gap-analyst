However, SANTANA's current skill set is not fully aligned with market requirements for the Senior AI Engineer position. This report analyzes SANTANA's strengths and gaps in key areas such as core requirements, preferred qualifications, emerging trends, and technology stack popularity to provide actionable insights on how to improve SANTANA's skills and increase their chances of success.

## Candidate Profile:
SANTANA MENA is a seasoned senior AI engineer with three years of experience. Prior to joining the current role, SANTANA worked as a software developer for two years. SANTANA has expertise in web development and problem-solving, which are core requirements in this position. However, they have limited experience with technology such as Kubernetes, Docker, AWS, Data Engineering, NLP, Computer Vision, and MLOps automation.

## Market Requirements Analysis:
The market requires a Senior AI Engineer who can demonstrate proficiency in Python, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, MLOps, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and at least one of the following languages: Scala, JavaScript, SQL, R. They also require strong leadership skills, experience with web development, and proficiency with technologies such as Docker, AWS, Git, MLflow, Weights & Biases, Jupyter.

## Skill Gap Assessment:
SANTANA has a critical skill gap in core requirements as they have limited experience with technology like Kubernetes, Docker, AWS, Data Engineering, NLP, Computer Vision, and MLOps automation. Additionally, SANTANA needs to upskill in LLM Fine-tuning, Prompt Engineering, Vector Databases, and MLOps Automation.

## Upskilling Roadmap:
To close the gap, SANTANA should complete a 6-week course on Kubernetes and Docker. They will also need to take an AWS certification course within the next three months. For Data Engineering and NLP, SANTANA can explore self-paced courses from Coursera or Pluralsight. Additionally, they must attend a workshop with MLOps automation experts.

## Recommended Resources:
- **Free Learning Platforms**: Websites like Coursera, Udemy, and LinkedIn Learning provide online courses that are free or low-cost.
