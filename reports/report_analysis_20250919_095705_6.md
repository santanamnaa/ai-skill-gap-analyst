# Executive Summary

## Introduction:
Santana Mena is an experienced software engineer who recently transitioned from a junior role to a senior AI Engineer. However, his current experience does not align well with the market requirements for Senior AI Engineers. We will now focus on identifying Santana's primary strengths and recommending actionable steps he can take to upskill himself in areas that are most needed by the job market.

## Key Recommendations:

1. **Skills Gap Analysis:** Santana's technical skills are good but do not include the preferred qualifications listed under Market Insights. He should prioritize learning technologies like Terraform, Aws, Go, Python, Azure, Docker, React, Rust, C++, and Express to increase his relevance in today’s market.

2. **Upskilling Roadmap:** Santana needs a 6-week plan with three phases that focuses on acquiring the required skills. For Phase 1, he will learn Terraform for infrastructure management, followed by Aws (for Amazon Web Services) and Go programming. For Phase 2, he will advance in Python development to become proficient in machine learning. Finally, for Phase 3, Rust is recommended as a next step since it is increasingly popular in the market.

3. **Upskilling Resources:** Santana should focus on free learning platforms such as Coursera and Udemy, which offer courses that are relevant to the job market. He can also practice hands-on with tools like Terraform, Aws, Git, Docker, and React through online resources or code repositories hosted by platforms like GitHub.

## Market Outlook:

Santana's current skills align well with the demand level for Senior AI Engineers. However, there is a growing need for professionals who are skilled in technologies such as AWS, Go, Python, Kubernetes, Rust, Java, Machine Learning, and Typescript. The salary range for this role ranges from $114,000 to $232,000.

## Future Market Trends:

The demand for AI is expected to grow significantly over the next few years. It’s estimated that by 2030, there will be more than one billion jobs globally requiring an understanding of artificial intelligence and machine learning, creating a significant pool of potential job seekers in this field. The technology stack popularity suggests a trend towards technologies like Python, Go, Rust, C++, Java, React, Docker, Terraform, AWS, Azure, Git.

## Conclusion:
Santana Mena has an opportunity to expand his skill set and increase his relevance by focusing on the recommended upskilling roadmap and relevant resources. This strategy will not only boost Santana's job prospects but also contribute to his overall growth as a professional in the industry.
